# Advent Of Codes
### What is advent of code
Advent of Code is an exciting annual event hosted on [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com/), where programmers worldwide gather to tackle daily programming challenges released from December 1st until Christmas. Each day unveils two tasks that progressively increase in difficulty, offering an engaging challenge and fostering a vibrant coding community as the holiday approaches.

### My approach
This year I will try to solve the puzzles with the use of the rust programming language. I have started a bit late (4th of December) so I do have some catching up to do.

### Why rust?
I chose Rust because I've had a strong interest in the language for a long time and I really like working with it.
